For assigning an arcane school to each rune here's the guide I came up with:
Abjuration
	protection
Conjuration
	Creation from nothing
Divination
	knowledge
Enchantment
	This one was tough. I took it to mean 'binding things together'
Evocation
	Releasing a latent power or energy
Illusion
	Imagery
Necromancy
	This is also tough. I think it's rarity could be explained by the flavor of the runic magic being more primal, more closely connected to the original magic.
	I went ahead and added it to any rune with 'polarity' to line up with the idea of UNlife.
Transmutation
	Something becoming something else.
